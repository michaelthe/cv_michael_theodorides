\section{Interests}

I have a deep love for technology.
From early age i always was interested in engineering.
So i decided to study computer engineering and science.
I believe in simple and intuitive designs without extra clutter and sophistication.
Although i realize that sometimes complexity is necessary to solve real problems.

I love books and the first thing that i get when i have to learn something new is a good book about the subject. And then ofcourse the Internet for the updates.

In my free time i usually workout or if the weather allows go for a long ride on my bicycle.
